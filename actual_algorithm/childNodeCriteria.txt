Node: A CargoState, a state of the cargo bay, including:
    - Ship manifest
    - Buffer manifest
    - Offload list
    - Load list
    - Cost

Edge: A move that changes on CargoState, somehow denoting:
    - Origin Area; "Ship", "Buffer", or "Truck"
    - Origin Coordinates; col, row?
    - Destination Area; "Ship", "Buffer", or "Truck" 
    - Destination Coordinates; col, row?
    - Container that is being moved
    - Maybe cost of the move?

    - Types of moves:
        Moving: 
        - Move some container C that is at the top of a column (of either
            the Ship or Buffer) and move it to the top of another column
            (of either the Ship or Buffer)

        Offloading:
        - You're object is to move some container C from the offload list
        - If C is at the top of it's column (accesible):
            - offload it from the ship to a truck
        - If not, Move container, T, that is at the top of the column that container C is in.

        Loading:
        - Load some container C from the load list from a truck:
            - to the top of any column in Ship
